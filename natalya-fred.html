                        <br />I am a dog, as you can see. My family says I am a 3 year old mutt but I believe I come from the noble bloodline of the Smooth Fox Terriers.

                        <span class="status-title">My Past: </span> 
                        <br /> I was adopted almost a year ago from <a href="http://www.animalrescue.org/"> Animal Rescue League.</a> I had two families before I became a Pinsper.</a>
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <span class="status-title">Something Intimate:</span> 
                        <br />In this handsome image of me, you see me carrying my own poop bag. I am a good dog.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><span class="status-title">Right Now:</span> 
                        <br />After a hard day of licking and snuggling, I am finally dozing on the couch.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><span class="status-title">Pet peeves:</span> <br />
                        Cats. All dogs except Lexie. Squirrels. Long distance car rides. Dry food. Hey, I did not ask to be domesticated, so give me chicken!
