                <p style = "text-align:center">this past winter, i returned to pittsburgh after travelling in california for a few months.  backpack style, i visited and stayed with friends and communities throughout the state in exchange for cooking, tending to plants - including pruning (ie climbing and sawing limbs off) trees - landscaping, chicken-raising, cat-sitting and <em>actually</em>, some website design.  while visiting a yoga sanctuary in the sierra nevada foothills, i was new to wordpress, but so was the yogi i was working for.  and because he'd rather meditate, i glady assumed the role of - well i wouldn't dare say "web designer" - but rather, the all-too-familiar role of "self-teacher".  the trip was also to decide if i might become a permaneant cali gal, but afterall, decided pittsburgh was where i wanted to be.</p>

                    <li>i want to put a small raised garden bed in the backyard, made from cement blocks.  construction junction MAY have just enough blocks to get this baby in the ground...atleast in time to grow kale. </li>
                    <li>after I have dug my heels in enough with the beginnings of web programming/design, I might want to continue teaching myself music-making with ableton (while I continue on with the web stuff, that is...)</li>
                    <li>i bet i am not the only one from the web programming class who wants to take another saxifrage class this summer...</li>
                    <li>i'm also thinking about reading david foster wallace's infinite jest this summer.  with everything else i want to do, i'm not just jesting myself, am i?</li>
                    <li>this totally turned into a 'wish list' of sorts that will be concluded before I get too far ahead of myself</li>
